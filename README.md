# Fixed_Timer
Nothing interesting here, I just needed an 'Always on Top' set of 1 to 5 Timers fixed at 2minutes and 30 seconds, individually reset, the only option for this specific use case required a paid License, so I just made my own.

Plug and play, if you need 1 to 5 timers fixed at 2minutes 30 seconds each that stay always on top of every App and have some transparency to not be fully intrusive, this does the job.

Alternatively you can go through the code and set new time options and generate a new executable. 

(Future updates would be a settings tab that allows to set how each timer works independently, but never got back to it, because the current state did the job for what i wanted).
